Module 4 Assignment

## Overview
Acting as the new Chief Data Scientist for my city's school district, I helped the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. As a first task, I analyzed the district-wide standardized test results. I was given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task was to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

## Summary

* The district had a total of 15 schools and 39,170 students. The budget for the district was $24,649,428.00.
* The highest-performing schools (by % overall passing) were Cabrera High School, Thomas High School, Griffin High School, Wilson High School and Pena High School.
*The lowest-performing schools (by % overall passing) were Rodriguez High School, Figueroa High School, Huang High School, Hernnadez High School and Johnson High School.
* Math Scores by Grade:

* Reading Scores by Grade

* Scores by School Spending:

* The average math score was 78.98% for the district, and the average reading score was 81.87%.
* 74.98% of students in the district passed math, whereas 85.80%  of students passed reading.
* The overall passing rate for students in math and reading was 80.39%.

## Conclusions

* Schools with higher budgets did not yield better test results. By contrast, schools with higher spending 645-675 per student actually underperformed compared to schools with smaller budgets (585 per student).
* Smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances (89-91% passing vs 67%).
* Charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics. However, more analysis will be required to glean if the effect is due to school practices or the fact that charter schools tend to serve smaller student populations per school.
